    "# Week 5: Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning\n",
    "# Pre-module\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "This week, we will introduce another tool that can be used to analyse data: Machine Learning (ML). By the end of this module, you should be able to:\n",
    "1. Define Supervised Machine Learning and understand its importance in biology.\n",
    "2. Explain the typical procedure to train an ML model.\n",
    "3. Implement a program to create an ML model using a Python framework called `sklearn`.\n",
    "4. Understand appropriate ways to evaluate the performance of an ML model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "First, you have probably heard both the terms machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) before and may be wondering what the difference is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intelligence. These tasks include recognizing patterns, learning from data, making decisions, and solving complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI. Rather than explicitly programming a computer to follow a fixed set of rules, in ML, we \"teach\" computers to learn from data. This is particularly useful in fields like biology, where there is an abundance of data, but the patterns and relations in the data are complex and hard for a human to parse through.\n"

    "AI and ML are becoming essential tools in biology, with applications such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Genomics: Identifying gene sequences associated with specific diseases.\n",
    "* Drug Discovery: Predicting which compounds may act effectively on certain targets, helping to speed up the drug discovery process.\n",
    "* Imaging and Diagnostics: Analyzing medical images (like MRI or histology slides) to identify patterns that might indicate disease.\n",
    "* Ecology and Evolution: Analyzing large-scale environmental data or understanding population dynamics and evolutionary patterns.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many of you have heard recent developments in ML, and these advancements continue to impact the way we work, learn, and coexist with technology. You may be surprised to find that machine learning is becoming increasingly important in biological research. A study by  [Walsh et al. (2021)](https://https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01205-4#citeas) shows an exponential increase of ML publications in biology since the 1990's, shown in the figure below."

    "### ML Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical Machine Learning pipeline consists of four key steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**: This involves collecting relevant data for the task and cleaning it up by removing or correcting inaccurate or inconsistent records.\n",
    "2. **Data Exploration**: Next, we analyze the data to manually identify potential trends and patterns through inspection and visualization.\n",
    "3. **Model Training**: Once we have explored our data, we train (or “fit”) a machine learning model. Ideally, the ML model will pick up patterns we have missed and will be able to outperform rules we discover.\n",
    "4. **Model Evaluation**: Finally, we assess the model’s performance using various metrics to determine how well it accomplishes the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, Week 3 covered Steps 1 and 2. We will practice Step 2 below, while Steps 3 and 4 will be covered in this week's main module."

    "Hopefully, you enjoyed the heart failure analysis from earlier weeks, because we have yet another task:\n",
    "\n",
    "You have recently moved to a new research lab within the Canadian Cancer Society, studying breast cancer cells. The Canadian Cancer Society estimates that 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer, with breast cancer constituting about 14% of cancer deaths among women. However, not all breast cancer cells are malignant. If there is a way to accurately detect if a particular breast cancer cell is benign or malignant early on, medical resources could be better allocated for better patient care. The team would like to find out if machine learning could be used to predict which cancer cells are benign or malignant, knowing that ML methods have been shown to be feasible in other cancer cell analyses in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been given a public dataset from the Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database*, containing features extracted from digitized images of breast cancer cell nuclei. From each image, researchers measured various characteristics, such as radius, texture, and symmetry, for each cell sample. For every characteristic, three types of values were computed:\n",
    "- **Mean**: the average value across the measured object \n",
    "- **Standard error (std)**: an estimate of the variability in the measurement\n",
    "- **Worst**: the mean of the three largest values observed\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurements and mean/std error/worst values comprise the features of this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `radius_mean` feature is the mean of distances from the center of the nucleus to various points on the perimeter. `radius_worst` is the mean of the three largest distances from the center of the nucleus to points on the perimeter. \n",

    "Take a moment to view the dataset **bc_data.csv** (using Excel or another .csv file viewer). \n",
