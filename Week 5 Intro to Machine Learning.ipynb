    "\n",
    "This week will introduce you to basic fundamental machine learning concepts. In the pre-module, you have been introduced to what machine learning is, and hopefully are motivated to learn more about how it works. Today, we will break down the stages in the ML pipeline so you can get a sense of what the input/outputs are to each stage. We will first explain key parts of data preparation, including data cleaning, feature selection, and data splitting, then give a glimpse of model training and evaluation, which will be covered in weeks 6 and 7, respectively. Understanding the pipeline at a high level will serve as a solid foundation before we delve into details on the inner workings of each stage in weeks 6 and 7. \n",
