    "# Tutorial Module\n",
    "\n",
    "This week will introduce you to basic fundamental machine learning concepts. In the pre-module, you have been introduced to what machine learning is, and hopefully are motivated to learn more about how it works. Today, we will break down the stages in the ML pipeline so you can get a sense of what the input/outputs are to each stage. We will first explain key parts of data preparation, then give a glimpse of model training and evaluation, which will be covered in weeks 6 and 7, respectively. Understanding the pipeline at a high level will serve as a solid foundation before we delve into details on the inner workings of each stage in weeks 6 and 7.\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "After completing this module, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Describe the stages of a typical machine learning (ML) pipeline from start to finish.\n",
    "2. Explain how data and information flow between different stages of the pipeline.\n",
    "3. Identify strategies to handle missing values and remove incorrect or redundant information during data cleaning.\n",
    "4. Identify and remove highly correlated features from a data set.\n",
    "5. Split a data set into a training set and a test set. Explain the motivation behind data splitting.\n",
    "6. Summarize the conceptual process of model training.\n",
